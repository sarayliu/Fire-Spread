Simulation of probabilistic forest fire spread to analyze how size and chance affect burnout time and how number of workers affects runtime. Used C and connected to infosphere to run on the cluster using MPI. Explored concepts of percolation, parameter search, and Monte Carlo methods. 8/26/19 - 10/18/19
